Transcriptomic analysis on public data for nuetrophils activation evidence in SSc for Dr. Darbousset-Nigrovic lab.

## Overview
This repository contains a complete and standardized analysis pipeline integrating:
- Differential expression analysis (DEA) using **limma-voom**
- Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (**fgsea**, Reactome, Hallmark, C2)
- Cross-dataset comparison of **neutrophil** and **platelet-related pathways**
- Per-dataset enrichment plots for publication

The workflow aggregates multiple public RNA-seq and microarray datasets related to **Systemic Sclerosis (SSc)** across distinct tissues (skin and blood), enabling direct comparison of shared immune pathways—especially neutrophil degranulation and platelet activation.
